This is a (growing, incomplete) list of my favorite R packages!

* [WRS](https://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/rwilcox/software/)
	* has an insane number of statistical techniques, free for public use!
* [boot](http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/bootstrapping.html)
	* bootstrapping (given a dataset and a statistic-generating function, returns bootstrapped results)
* [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html)
	* it's like data.frame, [but not terrible](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18001120/what-is-the-practical-difference-between-data-frame-and-data-table-in-r)
* [ggplot2](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)
	* graphics
* [ggthemes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/vignettes/ggthemes.html)
	* pre-made themes for ggplot2 so you can be lazy
* [Rmarkdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
	* to produce reports
* [Roxygen](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
	* to produce documentation
