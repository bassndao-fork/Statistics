# What's this going to tell me?
This master cheatsheet will tell you...

1. some different statistical problems (regression, classification, etc.)
2. the techniques used to model solutions to those problems
3. the assumptions those techniques require
4. the metrics that can be used to measure the effectiveness of the resulting models
5. how to use those techniques in [R and/or Python](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/r-numpy.html)

# Regression
## Linear Regression
### Ordinary Least-Squares Linear Regression
* R: `lm()`
* Python: `linear_model.LinearRegression().fit()` from sklearn
### Robust Linear Regression

---

# Classification
## Logistic Regression
* R: `glm()` from the mlogit package
* Python: `linear_model.LogisticRegression().fit()` from sklearn
## Decision Trees
